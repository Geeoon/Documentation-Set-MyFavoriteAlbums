## Publishing Your Version of My Favorite Albums
Once you have made changes you like, you can publish your app for others to use via the Internet. This would allow users to use the app via a URL, as long as they are connected to the Internet.  Users will be able to access the app from a URL similar to the example app: https://cholstro.shinyapps.io/shiny-music/.  This process requires an account on shinyapps.io.
