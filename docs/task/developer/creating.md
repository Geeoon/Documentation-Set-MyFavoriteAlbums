## Creating a CSV File
Albums are stored in the comma-separated values (CSV) format.  Each album is its own line.

1. Create a new file and open a new file with the following name: `album-rankings.csv`.  Make sure you do this outside of the project data directory.
2. On the first line of the file, type the following: `Year,Ranking,Album,Artist,Rating,Vinyl,EP,Live`
3. On the next line, type the following, in order, separated by commas without spaces:
* Album Release Year
* Album Ranking
* Album Name
* Album Artist Name
* Album Rating
* Album Vinyl Ownership Status (`v` or blank)
* Whether the release is an EP (`EP` or blank)
* Whether it is a live release (`Live` or blank)

4. For each album to add, follow step 3, such that each album is on a separate line.
5. Save the file and exit.
