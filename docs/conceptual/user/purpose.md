## The Purpose of My Favorite Albums

My Favorite Albums is intended to allow users to view the favorite albums of a particular person.  The albums are picked by the person hosting the website; end users do not have the ability to change this.  These ratings are subjective and entirely the opinion of that person.  My Favorite Albums provides various statistics related to the albums.
