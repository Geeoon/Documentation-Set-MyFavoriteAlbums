## What My Favorite Albums is Capable Of
My Favorite Albums is capable of gathering statistics albums across a large timeframe.  Developers have the ability to showcase 5 different categories of statistics:
 * “Number One Albums” to view the highest ranked album for each year within a range
 * “Bands and Artists” to view the rating of albums by a specific artist
 * “Top Albums by Year” to view a list of the highest ranked albums from a specific year, from highest to lowest ranked.
 * “Vinyl” to view statistics about vinyl ownership of albums
 * “Band Comparison” to graphically view the differences between two artists’ album ratings over time
In addition, developers can add, modify, or delete, any of the categories listed.
