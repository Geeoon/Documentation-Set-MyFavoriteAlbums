## The Purpose of My Favorite Albums
My Favorite Albums is intended to allow developers to display their favorite albums on a website.  Developer refers to the person using the My Favorite Albums code, not the one that created the My Favorite Albums code and repository.  A comma-separated value (CSV) list of album ratings are imported.  My Favorite Albums provides various statistics related to the albums and allows end users to use a website to view these statistics.
