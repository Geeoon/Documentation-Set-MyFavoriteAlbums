## Prerequisites for My Favorite Albums
To debug, program, and run the server, you must have an R compiler or interpreter as well as a package manager.  It is recommended to use RStudio to handle these tasks.  In addition, you will need the Shiny library to handle the frontend.  Finally, you need a .csv file that contains all of the albums you want to import into My Favorite Albums.  An example can be found here: https://github.com/UW-Example-Student/MyFavoriteAlbums/blob/main/data/album-rankings.csv.  This document assumes you have some knowledge with programming in the R language to make modifications to the code.
