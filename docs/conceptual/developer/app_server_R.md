## app_server.R
The app_server.R file defines the server to be used by Shiny.  The server defined in this file is different from the Shiny library server, as the app_server.R file is specifically for defining how the backend R code should be run by the Shiny server.  Each of the statistical tabs' behavior is programmed here.  My Favorite Albumâ€™s default code will call functions defined in other files to compile and serve the statistics.
