## Overview of My Favorite Albumsâ€™s Code Structure
My Favorite Album is programmed using the R programming language and uses the Shiny library to create the website.  Shiny is an interactive web application library that allows you to use R code on the backend.  The main file is the app.R file.  This file imports the other R files used by My Favorite Albums and starts the server.  The app_ui.R file defines the user interface for the application.  The app_server.R file defines how the different categories should be rendered.  The other R files define different ways of organizing and retrieving data from the imported .csv file.
