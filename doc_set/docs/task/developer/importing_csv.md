## Importing a CSV File
To import the CSV file you created, you need to replace the one included in the project.

1. Navigate to the data directory.
2. Delete the **album-ratings.csv** file currently included in the directory.
3. Put your custom **album-ratings.csv** file into the directory.

At this point, you may restart the server with your new album ratings.
